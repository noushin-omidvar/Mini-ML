## Projects

Each project within this repository is self-contained and focused on a specific aspect of machine learning. The projects cover a range of topics, including:

- Image compression with K-means

Feel free to explore the projects and choose the ones that interest you the most. Each project comes with detailed documentation and code explanations to help you understand the concepts behind the implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with Mini-ML Adventures, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. **Navigate to a Project:** Browse through the project folders to select the one you wish to work on.

3. **Read the Documentation:** Each project folder contains a README file with specific instructions, datasets (if required), and explanations of the ML techniques used.

## Dependencies

The projects in this repository are written in Python and require certain libraries to be installed to run smoothly. Here are the common dependencies you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for specific projects)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`, the Python package manager.

## Usage

For each project, follow the instructions provided in its respective README file. Usually, you can run the code in a Jupyter notebook or a Python script, depending on the project structure.
